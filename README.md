codeigniter-initializr
======================

It's a framework integrated with Codeigniter 2.1.3, Initializr(HTML5 Boilerplate &amp; Twitter Bootstrap), HMVC modular approach, Included a responsive template to start with. It's a great framework to kick-start any project.

I have added a cssdemo using the twitter bootstrap.

You can access some of the basic css functionality of Twitter bootstrap.
